```admonish warning
This is an old page, and hasn't been updated in over a year. It does not reflect the current state of the game and should be updated as soon as possible.
The page will be updated by the mapping work group soon (tm).

Until then, consult other mappers, people with the "Head Mapper" role, and the #cartography discord channel as for what content should be present in your map. **This should not be your sole source of information.**

# Mapping sins
=======
Don't do any of these. They make for bad looking/feeling maps.

## Ultra-wide hallways
So the thing about hallways is that they're empty.
This looks and feels bad to play in, with a very large amount of blank space visually.

### Ways to fix

#### Convert to a parkway
Filling the visual emptiness with plantlife or other decoratives helps significantly. This shouldn't be overdone, though, and it's preferrable to simply use smaller hallways.

## Abdundance of silver/gold tiles
To put it simply they look terrible, especially combined with decals, and should be used only in extremely specific situations.

### Ways to fix

#### Just change the theme
If you're using them to line a "rich feeling" room, say, the HoP's office, opt for instead focusing on a home-y feeling, with woods/etc. Most of the station simply does not have this feel and it'll make them seem exceptional.



# Mapping Checklist
===========

This checklist is a general guide on what items are required for typical SS14 station maps. Small maps and non-standard maps may not be able to fit all the content specified, so use this as general guidelines only.

When necessary, the entity ID will be in brackets if it differs greatly from the name of the item. In most cases, you can just search the name. Names with suffixes such as `[filled]` indicate a variant of an entity.

## Blacklist
The items in the following list should not be placed on maps under any circumstances. Unless you are 100% certain that the item is necessary for your map, do not place it, even if it's in a "hidden" location.

If you do choose to add one of these items, seek permission from a maintainer or the head mapper and specifically mention it in your PR.

- Nuclear Authentication Disk
- Nuclear Authentication Codes
- Items with the `[DEBUG]` suffix
- Items with the `[ADMIN]` suffix
- DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)
- Supersynth
- Dual Port Vents (at your own risk, colouring is a pain and they might not work)
- Traitor uplink items
- Tier 2 and Tier 3 research unlocks
- Romerol, in any form

### Item Checklist
Broken down by department and then by individual area, this contains what items should be mapped and what items can optionally be added. Like the rest of this checklist, this is merely guidelines, not written and stone, and does not apply to non-standard maps.
